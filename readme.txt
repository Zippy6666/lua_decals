Garry's mod addon that tries to increase the number of decals a single model can display using duplicate model layers.

Issues:
- Layers sometimes freeze in the air causing floating wounds
- Some layers just won't get removeed until map clean up, causing a build up of lag
- Some models don't work well with this and will instead sometimes cause decals to not be applied (citizens for example)
- Some blood mods flicker a lot when models have a lot of layers applied
